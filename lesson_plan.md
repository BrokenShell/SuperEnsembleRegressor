# Labs Data Science Workshop: Super Ensemble Regressor
## Instructor Notes

This lesson plan is aimed at preparing instructors to deliver a high quality live session to learners who have already prepared to work on the project by setting up any prerequisites before coming to class. The contents of this file are for the instructor only.


### 0. Instructor Prep List (Prior to Workshop)
- [ ] Read through `lesson_plan.md` to understand the timing and flow of the workshop.
- [ ] Read through the `lesson.ipynb` and make sure you understand all topics covered.
- [ ] Make sure the lesson notebook runs from top to bottom without errors.

### 1. Engage Classroom (1-2 min.)
- ***Remind learners of classroom expectations during live workshops***
- ***Pick one activity*** to help build an online community here at BloomTech and get learners excited for live instruction:
  - ***Icebreaker:*** Fun activity that helps learners get to know one another
  - ***Pulse Check:*** Pose a question for learners to gauge how they are feeling/get a pulse on how where they are at this point in the course
  - ***Do Now:*** Pose a question that involves no guidance from you. Used to activate students’ learning for the lesson, surface prior knowledge from pre-work, and familiarize students with today’s content
  - ***Celebrations:*** Share a learner celebration, job offer, remind students why they are putting in all this hard work


---
### 2. Getting Started (3-5 min.)
- Highlight the key concepts that will be covered during the live session.
  - Regressor
  - Ensemble
- Identify **new** topics that will be shown during this workshop.
  - Super Ensemble
- Explain how these concepts are critical on the job.
  - Often "real world" problems are far more complex than toy problems and sometimes, you just need a bigger hammer.
  - Knowing what you can do when the usual strategies fail is a good way to standout on the job.


---
### 3. What Are We Building? (2-3 min.)
Show an example of the finished product if applicable.


---
### 4. Let’s Build (30-40 min.)
Follow the lesson as described in the `lesson.ipynb` file.


---
### 5. Wrap Up (7-10 min.)
- ***Answer*** learner questions
- ***Restate*** key concepts of this workshop
  - When your Regressor just isn't big enough.
  - Combine various speciality models into one well-rounded model.
  - Try hyperparameter tuning first, it's often more rewarding and costs less.
- ***Suggest*** resources for continued learning
